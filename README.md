# Unitplanningtool
## What is unitplanningtool?
UnitPlanningTool is a custom Moodle plugin that was created for the purpose of automating the arduous paperwork that goes into the process of planning courses from the perspective of a department representative.

## The aim of the project
The ultimate aim is to automate the whole process with request/approval system that gets the input from a variety of different stakeholders that participate in the unit planning process. This could save time from manually following the process in paper documents and would also bring the additional benefits of keeping track of accountabilities and document the decision making process.

## Assumptions
1. There are a series of courses from previous semesters available for display
2. The courses are categorized into departments


### Project Dependencies
- Sorting of the courses is done using a Jquery tablesort library
